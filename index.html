      Having observed the impact of the 'fair trade' movement, and how connecting people directly via the internet had already transformed other industries, co-founders Nick and Matt set out to bring this change to financial services. They quickly realised that all people really want from financial services is a fair deal. And so the idea for Lending Works was born.

Through many months of hard work, the Lending Works idea grew from a basic concept on the back of an envelope into a dynamic business, which finally launched in January 2014 from a little office in Farringdon, London. Since mastering the art of office furniture assembly, Nick and Matt have taken on new responsibilities, namely the roles of CEO and CFO, and brought in a talented team to drive Lending Works forward. While the Lending Works team continues to grow rapidly, our focus has never shifted. We remain dedicated to 'pioneering fair financial services that people love'.
